            <p>Hi! I'm Karina Garcia, a 29-year-old career changer on an exciting journey into web development. After working in another industry, I realized I wanted a more creative and hands-on outlet — something that would let me build, express ideas, and constantly grow. That’s when I discovered my passion for web development.I'm currently learning through a combination of personal projects and a full-time coding bootcamp, where I'm gaining experience with front-end and back-end technologies. Building real-world projects from scratch has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding — and it's shown me how much I love solving problems and creating user-friendly experiences. This portfolio is a collection of what I’ve been working on so far. I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and sharing more as I go. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
